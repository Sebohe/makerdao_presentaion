What is MakerDAO?

Slide 2 (all the things) https://i.imgflip.com/ohrrn.jpg

I want everyone to be aware that I suffer from thinking that blockchain is going to solve all of the world problems.

Slide 3
MakerDAO is an organization that has been tackling the problem of creating a stable coin. A stable coin is a crypto currency in which its value has minimal variation in regards to fiat currency. The reason for creating a stable coin is make people be more willing to transact with crypto currencies. Many people that currently have crypto currencies like ether are not spending them. Why would they spend something which has the possibility of going in price tomorrow. We can agree that current crypto currencies are not a good currency due to their price volatility. Volatile currencies make it really hard to perform daily transactions. There is this famous story related with this. On May 22nd, 2010 someone bought two pizzas for 10000 bitcoins. Those bitcoins are worth a lot more dollars now a days. Having a stable coin is good for general business transactions. It removes the uncertainty of the price fluctuations and so now you are more willing to spend your crypto currencies. Stable coins will unlock a great potential in the current crypto coins ecosystem.

Before I go any further I want to mention that there are three cryto currencies that are involved in this system that I'm going to talk about. We have ether (ETH), maker (MKR), and dai (DAI)

MKR is the governance token of MakerDAO. Maker owners have the ability to propose new collaterals that could be used instead of solely relying on ether. Or they could also vote for increasing the collateral limit, which is right now 50 million usd. Maker owners are in charge of ensuring that the system runs well. This means that can control several parameters of system to maintain the stability of dai.

slide 5 (image of dai)
In December, MakerDAO released the first fully decentralized stable coin, the dai. The target price of the dai is 1 usd. What do I mean when I say completely decentralized? This means that all of the mechanism to maintain the stability of the dai are running on the ethereum blockchain with smart contracts. These mechanism include a processes for creating new dai, price keeping mechanisms, a way for closing down over exposed collateral, and a way to shutdown the dai system in a graceful manner. 

slide 6 (CDP balance and dai balance)
How is new dai created? The way dai get's generated is by placing ether as a collateral in a smart contract know as Collaterized Debt Positions, CDP. CDPs are similar to a permitionless credit system. In essence, you are lending out your ether to generate dai. Once a CDP is opened you are allowed to withdraw dai from the CDP. The amount of dai you can withdraw depends on the dollars worth of the collateral used in the CDP. This means that if you put 1000usd worth of ether in a CDP you can only withdraw 666 dai. The dai always has to be backed by 150% of ether. If the dai of a CDP is not backed by 150% or more of ether then the CDP is under collaterized. If your CDP is under collaterized, the system automatically liquidates your CDP, reclaims the collateral and sells it for the dai that was balanced against it. This is known as a market call. This is done to ensure that the dai that has been created is always backed by some collateral. 

When you want to close a CDP, all you need to do is pay back the dai that you have borrowed from the CDP plus a small fee.

Now I want everyone to be clear with what had just been accomplished. We just mortgage some ether, received some stable crypto coin, all without a bank.

Some use cases for the dai can include the following. A person can buy some dai at the market. Now he doesn't need to worry about the price volatility of crypto coins knowing very well that his dai is backed by an equivalent dolalrs worth of collateral. This other person can benefit from the stability of the dai with out opening a CDP. Another example is to create a CDP, take out some dai, and then use the dai to buy more ether. This is essentially a decentralized version of leverage trading. If the price of ether goes up, you can sell it for some dai and close the CDP.
 
What are some of the risks of the system? The main risk of the system is a complete crash of the collateral, ether. This would cause the whole system to be under collateralized. At this point a vote is called for a global settlement. When the global settlement is triggered, the system freezes. Then payments are sent out. If you own 100dai then you will be payed with 100usd worth of ether.
    
In the future, it is expect that by this summer. Dai is going to be backed by several collaterals, making it a multi collateral stable coin
