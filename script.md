Also, be warned. I have fever. And that fever is that blockchain will solve all of our problems. And be careful because this fever is really contagious.

MakerDAO is an organization that has been tackling the problem of creating a stable coin. This stable coin is known as Dai. A stable coin is a crypto currency in which its value has minimal variation in regards to a fiat currency. The reason for creating a stable coin is make people be more willing to transact in crypto currencies. Many people that currently have crypto currencies like ethereum or bitcoin are not spending them, because they think the value of those coins will up in regards to the dollar. This is not good for a currency to be widely used in several daily transactions. There is this famous story about this. On May 22nd, 2010 someone bought two pizzas for 10000 bitcoins. Those bitcoins are worth a lot more dollars now a days. Having a stable coin is good for general business transactions. It allows you to perform business transactions without having to worry about the crazy price fluctuations.

Before I go any further I want to mention that there are three cryto currencies that are involved in this system. We have ether (ETH), maker (MKR), and dai (DAI)

In December, MakerDAO released the first fully decentralized stable coin. The Dai, the target price of the dai is 1 usd. What do I mean when I say decentralized? This means that all fo the mechanism to maintain the stability of the dai are running on the ethereum blockchain with smart cntracts. These mechanism include a processes for creating new dai, a way for closing down over exposed collateral, and a way to shutdown the dai system in a graceful manner. 

How is new dai created? The way dai get's generated is by placing ether as a collateral in a smart contract know as Collaterized Debt Positions, CDP. CDPs are similar to a permitionless credit system. In essence, you are lending out your ether to generate dai. Once a CDP is opened you are allowed to withdraw dai from the smart contract. The main condition is that the CDP cannot be under collatarized. If your CDP is under collaterized, the system automatically liquidates your CDP, reclaims the collateral and sells it for the dai that was balanced against it. This is know as a market call. This is done to ensure that the dai that is in the market is always backed by some collateral. If you want to close your CDP then all you need to do is pay back the dai that you have borrowed from the CDP. 

Now I want everyone to be clear with what had just been accomplished. We just mortgage some ether, received spendable stable cash, all without a bank.

MKR is the governance token of the stable coin system. Maker owners have the ability to propose new collaterals that could be used instead of solely relying on ether. Or they could also vote for increasing the collateral limit, which is right now 50 million usd. Also if you want to close your CDP you have to pay a fee with MKR coins.

One interesting use case for the system is to create a CDP, borrow some dai, and then use the dai to buy more ether. This is essential a decentralized version of leverage trading.

    Black swan event:
    Bug
    Market colapse
    
Future, multilateral dai.
