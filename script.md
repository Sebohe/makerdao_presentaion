Slide 1

I want everyone to be aware that I believe that blockchains are going to solve all of the worlds problems. Every single one of them. I'm just kidding.

MakerDAO is an organization that has been tackling the problem of creating a stable coin. A stable coin is a crypto currency in which its value has minimal variation in regards to fiat currency. People that currently own crypto currencies like ether or bitcoin are not spending them. Why would they spend something which has the possibility of going up in price tomorrow.

slide 2 (pizza and price chart)

A famous example of this problem occured on May 22nd, 2010 someone bought two pizzas for 10000 bitcoins. Those bitcoins are worth a lot more dollars now a days. Simply put, most crypto coins are terrible currencies . Having a stable coin is good for general transactions. It removes the uncertainty of the price fluctuations therefor, people are more willing to accept the stable coin as a payment. MakerDAO believes that stable coins will unlock a great potential in the crypto currencies ecosystem.

Slide 3 (Image of all of the coins)

Before I go any further I want to mention that there are three cryto coins of which I'm going to talk about. We have ether (ETH), maker (MKR), and dai (DAI). All three of these are running on the the Ethereum blockchain.

slide 4 (image of mkr)

MKR is the governance token of Dai. Maker owners have the responsibility of governing the Dai stable coin. They also have the ability to propose new collaterals that could be used instead of relying only on ether. Maker owners can also vote for increasing the collateral limit, which is right now 50 million usd. Maker owners are in charge of ensuring that the system runs well. This means that MKR can control several parameters of the system to maintain the stability of dai. If MKR owners perform well, they are reward. The opposite is also true.

slide 5 (image of dai)

In December, MakerDAO released the first fully decentralized stable coin, the dai. The target price of the dai is 1 usd. What do I mean when I say completely decentralized? This means that all of the mechanism to maintain the stability of the dai are running on the ethereum blockchain. It is using ethereum smart contracts for this. Some of mechanisms for this system include a processes for creating new dai, price keeping mechanisms, a way for closing down over exposed collateral, and a way to shutdown the dai system in a graceful manner. 

slide 6 (CDP balance and dai balance)

How is new dai created? The way dai get's generated is by placing ether as a collateral in a smart contract known as Collaterized Debt Positions, CDP. CDPs are similar to a permitionless credit system. In essence, you are lending out your ether to generate dai. Once a CDP is opened you are allowed to withdraw dai from the CDP. The amount of dai you can withdraw depends on the dollars worth of the collateral in the CDP. If the CDP is under collaterized, the system automatically liquidates your CDP, reclaims the collateral and sells it for the dai that was balanced against it. This is known as a market call. This is done to ensure that the dai that has been created is always backed by some collateral. 

When you want to close a CDP, all you need to do is pay back the dai that you have borrowed from the CDP plus a small fee of MKR.

Now I want everyone to be clear with what has just been accomplished. We just mortgage some ether, received some stable crypto coin, all without a bank. I find this pretty amazing.

Some use cases for the dai can include the following. A person can buy some dai at the market. Now that person doesn't need to worry about the price volatility of crypto coins knowing very well that his dai is backed by an equivalent dollars worth of collateral. This person can benefit from the stability of the dai with out opening a CDP.

Another use case is create a CDP, take out some dai, and then use the dai to buy more ether. If the price of ether goes up, you can sell it for some dai and close the CDP at a profit. This is essentially a decentralized version of margin trading. 

A third use case is using dai in a predictions market like Augur. Now you aren't on betting the speculative price of ether.
 
 Slide 8 (risks)
 
What are some of the risks of the system? The main risk of the system is a complete crash of the collateral, ether. This would cause the whole system to be under collateralized. At this point a vote is called for a global settlement. When the global settlement is triggered, the system freezes. Then payments are sent out. If you own 100dai then you will be payed with 100usd worth of ether. Another risk is if there is an unknown bug in the code.
    
Dai is expected to have multiple colalterals by summer 2018, giving more robustness to the stable coin.

Thank you.
